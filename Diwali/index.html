    <h1><b><big>Diwali, as the word connotes is about the diyas, or ghee-filled, small earthen bowl with batti we light on Diwali. The festival celebrates the homecoming of Lord Rama. The story is often shared through the Ramayana performed by various artists. The festivities begin with Dhanteras, when the god of wealth, Kuber, is being worshipped for prosperity. Then comes the Chotti Diwali or the day before Diwali, that day it said that after cleaning our homes, offices and other surroundings we shall clean ourselves and enhance our looks. Then on the occasion of Diwali people worship gods and goddesses such as Ram, Sita, Hanuman, Ganesh, Laxmi and Saraswati, as well. Sweets are shared among the people, and everyone visits each other homes and wishes them well. Then the kids light crackers and celebrate the ending of the exile period of Ram. </big></b></h1>
