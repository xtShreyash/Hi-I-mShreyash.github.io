    <b><big><h1>1.Enhanced Leadership Skills</h1></big></b>
    
    
    <b><h1>Summer camps are the unsung hero’s that provide opportunities for early leadership development. They act as the primary training ground for leadership – both local and global. Chji are divided into groups, and each group has a leader who has to lead the groups towards winning. The leaders are frequently changed to give each child an equal opportunity to showcase their skills.</h1></b>
    
    
    <b><h1><big>2.Build Friendships and Learn Social Skills</big></h1></b>
    
    <b><h1>When in a school, the structured schedule makes it hard for scholars to build friendships. However, in a summer camp, they have numerous opportunities to meet new students and form a lasting bond. Camp friendships are mostly created over inside jokes, shared experiences and similar life events. At the end of the camp, the confidence level and the ability to tackle social situations also increase.</h1></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><h1><big>3.Improved Decision-Making Skills</big></h1></b>
    
    <h1><b>There is no doubt that summer camps offer the benefits of autonomy and freedom in a safe and controlled environment. An environment like this helps in making the children  consistent with their actions while requiring them to take decisions that someone else previously made for them. This sense of ownership instils a feeling of freedom handled responsibly.</b></h1>
    <br>
    <br>

    <b><h1><big>4. Improved Communication Skills</big></h1></b>
    
    <h1><b>Another benefit of summer camp is the improvement it provides in communication skills. Social and communicative skills usually build as the child grows, but summer camps prove to be an excellent opportunity to brush them up. Kids constantly have to communicate with their fellow campers to accomplish tasks and activities. Constant communication allows them to be more open about their thoughts and feelings while proving beneficial in the long run.</b></h1>

    <big><h1><b>Final Words</b></h1></big>

We at Genesis Global School, understand the importance of summer camp activities for children and have made summer camp a yearly ritual. We push the campers to explore their individual interests while having a great experience at the camp – memorable, diverse and rewarding.
